  description: Shot noise has been suggested for a long time as a tell-tale probe for Majorana bound states. We are the first to carry out local tunneling shot noise measurements on the putative vortex Majorana states.

- title: "Puddle formation, persistent gaps, and non-mean-field breakdown of superconductivity in overdoped (Pb,Bi)2Sr2CuO6+Î´"
  image: BSCCOgap.png
  description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.
