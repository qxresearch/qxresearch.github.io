  description: "Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable, progressive neurological disease that causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to die. Earlier detection of Alzheimer’s disease can lead to proper treatment and prevent brain tissue damage. So accurate and fast detection of Alzheimer is most important. There are many well-established models which can predict Alzheimer’s disease, but they struggle with imbalanced datasets. This work has focused on the early and fast detection of Alzheimer’s disease from an imbalanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset using a proper variational autoencoder (VAE) model. Firstly, the whole dataset has been converted into a latent vector form; then, we used some popular sampling methods to balance the dataset. Finally, we applied some classification algorithms to classify the brain MRI images into four different classes: ‘Very Mild Demented,’ ‘Mild Demented,’ ‘Non-Demented,’ and ‘Moderate Demented.’ In order to maintain stability in the results, we have applied tenfold cross-validation. In our experiment, it indicates an improvement in results to detect Alzheimer’s disease using VAE."

  description: Shot noise has been suggested for a long time as a tell-tale probe for Majorana bound states. We are the first to carry out local tunneling shot noise measurements on the putative vortex Majorana states.

- title: "Puddle formation, persistent gaps, and non-mean-field breakdown of superconductivity in overdoped (Pb,Bi)2Sr2CuO6+δ"
  image: BSCCOgap.png
  description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.

  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

- title: "Imaging moiré deformation and dynamics in twisted bilayer graphene"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.
