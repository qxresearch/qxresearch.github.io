    description: "Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable, progressive neurological disease that causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to die. Earlier detection of Alzheimer’s disease can lead to proper treatment and prevent brain tissue damage. So accurate and fast detection of Alzheimer is most important. There are many well-established models which can predict Alzheimer’s disease, but they struggle with imbalanced datasets. This work has focused on the early and fast detection of Alzheimer’s disease from an imbalanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset using a proper variational autoencoder (VAE) model. Firstly, the whole dataset has been converted into a latent vector form; then, we used some popular sampling methods to balance the dataset. Finally, we applied some classification algorithms to classify the brain MRI images into four different classes: ‘Very Mild Demented,’ ‘Mild Demented,’ ‘Non-Demented,’ and ‘Moderate Demented.’ In order to maintain stability in the results, we have applied tenfold cross-validation. In our experiment, it indicates an improvement in results to detect Alzheimer’s disease using VAE."

    description: "Soil moisture prediction is one of the emerging fields in the domain of smart agriculture. Ample moisture levels are of high importance to yields; thus, plants will not grow and develop with inadequate soil moisture, which influences soil temperature and heat capacity and also prevents soil from weathering. Accurate soil moisture detection can lead to proper growth of all kinds of trees and crops. In this chapter, we have implemented a deep learning and few transfer learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), VGGNet (VGG-16, VGG-19), Inception v3, ResNet50, Xception for prediction of soil moisture based on a very small custom dataset of 626 field images of rural India over a period of 10 days, both with and without the effect of data augmentation. We have also demonstrated how these pretrained algorithms save both time and resources compared to traditional deep learning models. Here, multiclass classification is considered based on three different classes, viz. “dry,” “wet,” “extremely wet."

- title: "Puddle formation, persistent gaps, and non-mean-field breakdown of superconductivity in overdoped (Pb,Bi)2Sr2CuO6+δ"
    image: BSCCOgap.png
    description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.
